## Description

This tool hands out configuration data over a REST api. The configuration values
are stored in files in YAML format. The key idea here is that these files are
in some kind of version control so each change is tracked and access rigths are
enforced.

## Dependencies

* YAML
* cherrypy
* nosetests
